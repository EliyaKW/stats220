*The purpose of this repo is to present my work for projects in **STATS 220**.*

### A bit about me :smile:

I enjoy reading and these are a few books I found insightful:

1. Scrubbed - Nikki Stamp
2. Born a Crime - Trevor Noah
3. The Hard Road Out - Jihyun Park and Seh-Lynn Chai

I am majoring in **Statistics** at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html).
